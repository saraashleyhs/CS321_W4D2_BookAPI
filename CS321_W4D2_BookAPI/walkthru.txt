1. Add a new Core project to the solution.
   1. Right-click on the Solution (the topmost node in the solution explorer) and choose Add > Add New Project.
   1. In the .Net Core section, choose Library, and then Class Library.
   1. Name it CS321_W4D2_BookAPI.Core.
1. Add a new Infrastructure project to the solution.
   1. Right-click on the Solution and choose Add > Add New Project.
   1. In the .Net Core section, choose Library and then Class Library.
   1. Name it CS321_W4D2_BookAPI.Infrastructure.
1. You should now have three projects in your solution, like this:
   * CS321_W4D2_BookAPI
   * CS321_W4D2_BookAPI.Core
   * CS321_W4D2_BookAPI.Infrastructure
1. Now we need to add references to our BookAPI project so it can use the code that will exist in Core and Infrastructure.
   1. Expand the BookAPI project. 
   1. Right click on the **Dependencies** and choose **Edit References**.
   1. Choose the Projects tab. You should see a list of the other two projects, Core and Infrastructure.
   1. Check both projects and click Ok. 
1. In the Infrastructure project, let's add a referece to the Core project.
   1. Expand the Infrastructure project.
   1. Right click on the **Dependencies** and choose **Edit References**.
   1. Choose the Projects tab. You should see a list of the other two projects, Core and BookAPI. Notice that it won't let you choose BookAPI because that would cause a cyclical reference -- BookAPI already references Data, so Data can't reference BookAPI.
   1. Check the Core project and click Ok. 
1. While we're in the Infrastructure project, we need to add EntityFramework packages so we can use EF.
   1. Right click on **Dependencies** and choose **Add Packages**.
   1. Search for and add each of the three following packages:
      1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
      1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
      1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
      1. Wait a moment and accept all licenses.
1. Move the Data folder from BookAPI into Infrastructure. You can delete the Class1.cs file that was added by default when you created the project.
1. Move the Models folder from BookAPI into Core. You can delete the Class1.cs file that was added by default.
1. Move the Services folder from BookAPI into Core.
1. Try building the project. It should compile successfully. If you run it, though, you may get an error because we haven't created the database yet.
